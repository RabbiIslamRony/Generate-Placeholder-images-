## Placeholder Limitations

While the Image Placeholder Generator is a powerful tool, there are certain limitations to be aware of:

1. **Image Size:** The application's efficiency may be affected when processing very large images. It's recommended to use images with reasonable dimensions for optimal performance.

2. **Picture Limit:** Users can upload a maximum of 20 images in a single upload session. If you need to process more images, consider breaking them into smaller batches.

3. **Total Size Limit:** The total size of all uploaded images in a single session should not exceed 30 MB. Exceeding this limit may result in processing issues.

4. **Supported Formats:** The application supports common image formats such as JPG, PNG, and GIF. However, more exotic or less common formats may not be fully supported.

5. **Browser Compatibility:** The application relies on modern web technologies, and its performance may vary across different web browsers. It's recommended to use the latest versions of popular browsers for the best experience.

6. **Processing Time:** The time it takes to generate placeholders depends on factors like the number and size of the uploaded images. Large batches of high-resolution images may increase processing time.

## How to Address Limitations

- **Image Optimization:** Before uploading images, consider optimizing them for web use. This can help improve processing speed and reduce potential issues with large file sizes.

- **Batch Processing:** If you have more than 20 images to process, break them into smaller batches and upload them separately.

- **Total Size Management:** Be mindful of the total size of uploaded images; ensure it does not exceed the 30 MB limit.

- **Browser Updates:** Ensure your web browser is up to date. This can help mitigate potential compatibility issues and ensure a smoother user experience.

- **Feedback and Support:** If you encounter any issues or have specific requirements, feel free to open an issue on the project's GitHub repository. Your feedback helps in identifying and addressing limitations.

Please keep these limitations in mind when using the Image Placeholder Generator. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out or contribute to the project's improvement.
